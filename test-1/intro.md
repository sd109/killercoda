### Welcome to StackHPC's Killercoda challenge

This is a self-contained Kubernetes environment with access to standard Kubernetes tools such as `kubectl`.

You will be guided through a sequence of short problem solving tasks. These are intended to be a challenge and you are not expected to know all of the answers immediately - having a clear process for tackling unfamiliar problems is much more important!
